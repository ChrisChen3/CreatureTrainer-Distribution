CreatureTrainer-Distribution
============================
https://github.com/gameprof/CreatureTrainer-Distribution.git

The distribution code for the CreatureTrainer Project

This is the human-playable version of CreatureTrainer. We will be making changes to the balance of the game and updating code as we go, so you should download the new version whenever your code gets out of date.

Of the files that are included in the distribution, you should only modify Trainer.h and Trainer.cpp. Please leave all the other files alone.

When you first get this code, make sure it compiles for you, and try playing the game yourself. Think about what decisions you're making as a player. What should you take notes on to learn about the different kinds of enemies and which ones you should send specific creatures in your party to fight. It could mean the difference between life and fainting.
